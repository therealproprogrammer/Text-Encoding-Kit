# Text-Encoding-Kit
Neural networks are very powerful algorithms in machine learning, but they only accept numbers.
Use the functions in this kit to encode string arrays into numerical arrays that can be processed by neural networks.
Beware that large and deep neural networks require lots of computational resources.
