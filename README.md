# Text-Encoding-Kit
Neural networks are very powerful algorithms in machine learning, and thus have been used extensively. However, they only accept numerical values, as computers are unlike humans.
Use the functions in this kit to encode string (or word) arrays into numerical arrays that can be processed by neural networks.
Beware that large and deep neural networks require lots of computational resources. Therefore, it is recommended to use a low-level API for the neural network itself. Theano and Keras (with a Theano backend) are good examples.
